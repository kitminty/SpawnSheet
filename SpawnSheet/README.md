# CheatSheet
Cheat Sheet is a tool for developers and those who just want to play around with any vanilla or mod items/recipes/NPC.

A special thanks to the Gameiki team for developing the UI toolkit used and the original design and code for 
the Item Browser and the amazingly sweet-looking Hotbar, along with their corresponding textures. 
Without them, this mod would look super ugly.

Recipe Browser is also available without Cheat Sheet, [git here](https://github.com/JavidPack/RecipeBrowser).

## Current features
### Hotbar
___

### Extra Accessory Slots
___
Choose between 0 and 6 extra accessory slots. (I know, overkill.)

The items in the slots will save with your character. 
Also note that you can bypass typical accessory limits.
